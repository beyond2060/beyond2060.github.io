<h1>Current work</h1>

<h2><img src="logos/dialog.png"  class="logo"/>Dialog Semiconductor</h2>
<p><i>2009 - present</i></p>
<p>The amount of work I do for Dialog has grown as they have grown. Currently, I lead a team that provides continuous support, development and maintenance to <a href="https://www.dialog-semiconductor.com/" target="_blank">the corporate website</a>. I proactively manage and implement refinements to the site to improve customer experience, lead generation and content creation. I improve the website with each iteration, rapidly integrating other sites as Dialog acquires other companies. The long term technology strategy I developed for Dialog has proven very successful, allowing us to support over 20,000 customers across multiple diverse business units, and to quickly adapt to changing requirements.</p>


<h2><img src="logos/en.png"  class="logo"/>Electronics-notes and Radio-Electronics</h2>
<p><i>2010 - present</i></p>

<p><a href="https://www.electronics-notes.com" target="_blank">Electronics-Notes.com</a> (previously radio-electronics) is a website dedicated to explanations of electronics. It serves around million page views a month, exceeding many other sector publications. I have had a long collaboration with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ian-poole-14719b1/" target="_blank">Ian Poole</a>, the site editor and owner. I designed the site, managed its technical development, improved SEO, and developed new ideas.</p>


<h2><img src="logos/eu.png"  class="logo" style="width:100px;padding-right:50px;"/>EU Health Innovation Projects</h2>
<p><i>2020 - present</i></p>
<p>I am an expert evaluator for the IT component of <a href="https://eithealth.eu/" target="_blank">EU Health Innovation</a> projects, including fast-tracked Covid related projects.</p>

<h1>Notable projects</h1>

<h2><img src="logos/redux.png"  class="logo"/>Redux ST</h2>
<p>Redux Sound and Touch created products and bespoke systems to enable customizable, high-resolution haptic feedback. I worked with their engineers to design and implement an interactive demonstrator of their haptic feedback product. The demo was created to look like an interactive touchscreen automotive control panel, with functionality to select music, make a phone call, etc. I used Javascript web-sockets to interface with their hardware. </p>
<p>I also designed and implemented the Redux ST website. Redux ST was acquired by Google.</p>

<h2><img src="logos/ericsson.png"  class="logo" style="width:100px;padding-right:50px;"/>Ericsson Power</h2>
<p>I created two micro-sites for Ericsson Power to gather prospects. I also created an animated video which gave an overview of their technology, working with an actor to sync the video with the narration.</p>

<h2><img src="logos/picochip.png"  class="logo"/>picoChip</h2>
<p>picoChip was one of the pioneers of the concept of the femtocell/small cell and the leading developer of femtocell technology. I had a nine year successful collaboration with the founder of picoChip, <a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/peterclaydon" target="_blank">Peter Claydon</a>, and VP Marketing <a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/rupertbaines" target="_blank">Rupert Baines</a>. As well as designing, implementing and maintaining their website, I created presentations for shows such as MWC and worked with their engineers to create interactive courses about their technology.</p>
<p>Picochip was acquired by Californian company Mindspeed Technologies Inc.</p>

<h2><img src="logos/audium.png"  class="logo"/>Audium Semiconductor</h2>
<p>Audium created a highly power efficient audio power amplifier technology. The technology was a complex one to explain, and I developed a promotional video for it. The job was memorable because they only had a single demo unit which they could only lend to me for a couple of hours, so I look it to a nearby photography studio and got photographs taken from multiple angles. I then worked with an actor who did the demonstration, and I made a composite video using the photographs to make it look as though the demonstrator was using the demo equipment.</p>
<p>I also designed and implimented the Audium website.</p>

<h2><img src="logos/renesas.png"  class="logo"/>Renesas</h2>
<p>I designed and implemented the <b>Renesas Microchooser</b>. The Microchooser was "the ultimate parametric search tool for 8, 16 and 32-bit microcontrollers, combining ease of use with instant results". It was very successful and went through five major revisions over a period of five years. The final version listed over 2000 products. It resulted in a significant number of valuable leads (the last figure I have is for end 2006 - 4511 registrations).</p>
<p>I also developed the stand-alone website from the Microchooser, and the accompanying eshots.</p>

<h2><img src="logos/oxsemi.png"  class="logo"/>Oxford Semiconductor</h2>
<p>Oxford Semiconductor developed a range of high-speed proprietary integrated circuits for use in data communications, storage, and connectivity. I worked with the founder <a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/mrjameslewis">James Lewis</a> to create an interactive, animated presentation which was successfully used to explain the technology to potential funders. I also designed and implemented their website over two versions as the company grew. </p>

<p>I worked with Oxford Semiconductor for eight years until it was acquired by PLX Technology.</p>

<h2><img src="logos/varta.png"  class="logo"/>Varta Batteries</h2>
<p>I designed and implemented a promotional website for a Varta thin battery technology. The website included a 3d version of the Varta battery, which you could rotate. Different features of the battery were labelled as you rotated it.</p>

<h2><img src="logos/papst.png"  class="logo"/>ebm-papst</h2>
<p>I designed and implemented the Papst website, and created various interactive calculator tools, over a period of six years.</p>

<h2><img src="logos/kc.png"  class="logo"/>The Kennel Club</h2>
<p>I worked with the Kennel Club geneticist on a website and interactive tool to teach dog breeders how to eliminate genetically inherited diseases.</p>

<h2><img src="logos/nhm2.png"  class="logo"/>The Natural History Museum</h2>
<p>I worked full time for the Natural History Museum until 1998, and then worked with them on various projects after setting up my own company.</p>

<p>Whilst working for the museum I designed the Natural History Museum website, which first launched in 1997. It was one of the top websites in the UK at that time. I also was the project lead for the museum for a large EU funded project, which resulted in the creation of a virtual reality version of James Cook's ship The Endeavour. </p>

<p>Upon leaving the museum my company was contracted to create the museum-wide touchscreen vistor information system. It was in twelve languages.</p>

<h2><img src="logos/logica.png"  class="logo"/>Logica PLC</h2>
<p>I worked full time for the Logica finance division for around two years, including programming the interace to a hardware encryption device for the BoE and Lloyds, and installing mainframe systems for JP Morgan.</p>

<h2>Other clients</h2>

<p>I have worked on websites, animated advertising banners, eshots, interactive kiosks, videos and presentations for a variety of other clients. As well as clients in the electronics sector, I have done a number of very interesting projects for museums and non-profit organisations.</p>
